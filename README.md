# screen_reader_experience
Web page to experience navigating accessible and inaccessible pages using a screen reader

## About

This page was made for my final project for the class Emerging Trends in Information and Technology. The purpose of this project is to explore how different HTML options make web pages more accessible for use with screen readers. Viewers will be able to access an example of a page that implements many of the important HTML practices that make web pages more accessible and as a contrast there will be a page that doesn't implement these practices. Users are encouraged to explore both pages using a screen reader, so that they can have first hand experience of how their HTML practices impact user experiences.

You can find [usage instructions](https://lujoh.github.io/screen_reader_experience/) on the first page of the project.

                <p>
                    The purpose of this project is to explore how different HTML options make web pages more accessible for use with screen readers. Viewers will be able to access an example of a page that implements many of the important HTML practices that make web pages more accessible and as a contrast there will be a page that doesn't implement these practices. Users are encouraged to explore both pages using a screen reader, so that they can have first hand experience of how their HTML practices impact user experiences. Below there will be instructions about how to use the pages and how to get and use a screen reader.

                <p>
                    Users are encouraged to explore both the accessible and the inaccessible example page and try to access different parts and functions of the pages using a screen reader to experience the difference. The two pages are listed in the navigation section of this page.

                    Before you access each page make sure that the screen reader is turned on. Then click on the link of the page you want to look at.

                <h3>About this project</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this project is to explore how different HTML options make web pages more accessible for use with screen readers. Viewers will be able to access an example of a page that implements many of the important HTML practices that make web pages more accessible and as a contrast there will be a page that doesn't implement these practices. Users are encouraged to explore both pages using a screen reader, so that they can have first hand experience of how their HTML practices impact user experiences. Below there will be instructions about how to use the pages and how to get and use a screen reader.

                <h3>How to use the project</h3>
                <p>
                    Users are encouraged to explore both the accessible and the inaccessible example page and try to access different parts and functions of the pages using a screen reader to experience the difference. The two pages are listed in the navigation section of this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you access each page make sure that the screen reader is fully set up and turned on. Check the section "Screen reader instructions" to learn more. Then click on the link of the page you want to look at. On both pages there is a button in the top left corner that toggles "invisible mode", which lets you explore the content of the page without it being displayed on the screen. For a first time exploring the page, I would recommend turning on the invisibility mode to experience what it's like to navigate an unfamiliar page with the screen reader. A strategy to get an idea of the general layout and content of the page is to browse all of the headings. Do this as a first step. After that you can navigate through the links by tabbing and navigate all the details of the page using the general scrolling instructions.
                </p>
                <h4>Some things you can look out for while navigating the page</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you get a good idea of the content of the page?</li>
                    <li>Can you get to all the links? Do you know where the links will go before clicking them?</li>
                    <li>Are you able to fill out the form and submit it? Can you find out if the form was submitted successfully?</li>
                    <li>Are there any parts of the website that are confusing?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After navigating the page in invisible mode, you can switch back to visible mode. Take a look around. Does the page look like you expected it to? Try and see if there are any parts that you missed in invisible mode and see if you can find a way to access them now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in web development or coding, you can press ctrl + u, or right-click and click "inspect source" to look at the code behind the page to see how things were done.

                <h4>How to install a screen reader</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many different screen readers, and you are welcome to try different ones, but what I used to navigate the page is ChromeVox. ChromeVox is a free Chrome extension that is quick and easy to install. You have to be using Google Chrome as your browser to use it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use ChromeVox, go to the Chrome Web store, search for ChromeVox and install it. Once it is done installing you can click on the "options" button on the screen reader extension, which you will find under the extensions button in the Chrome toolbar. There you can adjust many different settings as you like, but the essential one you need to do is add a ChromeVox modifier key under Keyboard Shortcuts. I used the Alt key for mine, but you can use whichever key suits you. Remember which key you entered here, because you will use it in the section below, where I will name it CV-key (Digital Education Strategies, 2019).<br>

                <h4>How to navigate with a screen reader</h4>
                <p>
                    When you first open a page ChromeVox will announce the title of the page as it it listed in the code. If you are navigating by mouse, you can click in any area and ChromeVox will read out the text. To navigate by keyboard there are multiple ways of moving around. If you use your CV-key (as specified above) in combination with the up and down arrow keys you can go through a page section by section and it will read out everything. If you are just scrolling through links, form fields and buttons you can use tab to go forward and shift tab to go backward. To browse a list of all the headings in a page you can press CV-key, L, H, and it will open up a list of headings that you can navigate with the up and down arrow keys. To get out of the list you can press the esc key (Digital Education Strategies, 2019).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are just some of the basic ways to navigate with ChromeVox that will help you navigate this project. If you are interested in becomming more advanced in screen reader navigation, I would recommend reading more in the <a href="https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/iwacc/chapter/chromevox-screen-reader/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> by Ryerson University.
